# IPTV-Bundle-Customizer
Allows you to quickly deploy different instances of Cigara's IPTV.bundle


@godztian requested a feature which would make it possible to quickly deploy several instances of @Cigara's IPTV.bundle, without having him to alter all the required files him-/herself.
As far as I see, such a feature it not possible to create within the bundle itself as you'd have to alter the package name on runtime.
That's why I decided to put together this little script which does the job automatically for you.
At least @godztian will happy with it I guess.
Request @ https://github.com/Cigaras/IPTV.bundle/issues/101


# Installation
Drop these files on some host/server which runs PHP.

# Usage
Browse to index.php once you've uploaded the files to a host/server. Enter a name for your bundle and click the button. Done.

# Future updates
Not sure if I'll add extras to this. Just wanted to make someone happy with this. If you have any special requests, feel free to let me know :-)
